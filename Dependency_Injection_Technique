# Dependency Injection Technique

## What is Dependency Injection?

- Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. 
- It achieves that by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation.
- This helps you to follow SOLIDâ€™s dependency inversion and single responsibility principles.
- The dependency injection technique is a popular alternative to the service locator pattern. 
- A lot of modern application frameworks implement it. These frameworks provide the technical parts of the technique so that you can focus on the implementation of your business logic. 

## What is the Goal of Dependency Injection?

- The goal of the dependency injection technique is to remove this dependency by separating the usage from the creation of the object. 
- This reduces the amount of required boilerplate code and improves flexibility.

## The Interfaces and the Dependency Injection

- You can introduce interfaces to break the dependencies between higher and lower level classes. 
- IF you do that, both classes depend on the interface and no longer on each other.
